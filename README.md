## About
Simple Parser using Antlr4 to parse Grammar
### Phase 1
Basic arithmetic expressions can be parsed such as 
```
Variable1 = 1
Variable2 = Variable1 + 2
Variable3 = Variable2 / Variable2
```
There are cases of invalid expressions that include
```
Variable1 = (variable2 = 3) + 1
Variable3 = 1 +*/ 3
```
### Phase 2
Implementation of If/Else statements and comparison statements such as
```
if(Variable1 == True):
    Variable2 = True
else if(Variable3 <= 7):
    Variable2 = False
else:
    Variable2 = 5
```
### Phase 3
Implementation of comments, as well as some other things.
